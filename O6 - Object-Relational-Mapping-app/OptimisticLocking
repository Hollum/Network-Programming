Optimistic locking is a strategy for reading data in a database.
We declare a variable as @Version in an entity class. If there are two transaction
happening at the same time the last transaction, that is finish, will
look at the version variable. If the "official" version variable is equal to
locally stored version variable the transaction can fulfill. On the
other hand if the version variable is changed the transaction knows that
the data is corrupt and starts the transaction again.
